# 🔢 calculator - The Odin Project

A clean and functional on-screen calculator built as part of **The Odin Project Foundations course**.  
This project combines **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** fundamentals into a single app, testing DOM manipulation, state management, and event-driven programming.

## 🚀 Features

- **Basic arithmetic operations**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- **Chained operations**: the calculator stores the previous result for further calculations.
- **Clear Entry (CE)** button: resets the display and internal state.
- **Division by zero handling**: shows a friendly error instead of crashing.
- **Responsive layout**: grid-based design for a classic calculator look.
- **Dark mode design**: styled with CSS for a modern aesthetic.
- **Hover effects**: subtle transitions for better UX.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** – semantic structure
- **CSS3** – custom styles, flexbox layout, dark theme
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM manipulation, event listeners, state handling

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Managing **application state** with variables (`firstNumber`, `operatorSelected`, `waitingSecondNumber`).
- Handling **user input events** dynamically with `addEventListener`.
- Using **functions for modular arithmetic operations**.
- Practicing **DOM updates** by reflecting state changes in the input field.
- Handling **edge cases** (like dividing by zero).
